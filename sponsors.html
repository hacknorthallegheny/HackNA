		<h3><b>What is HackNA?</b></h3>
		<p>HackNA is a hackathon for middle and high school students in the Greater Pittsburgh Area scheduled for December 16, 2017 at North Allegheny Senior High School. A hackathon is a competition where teams create a hardware or software project (robots, games, Android/iOS apps, or whatever they’re interested in) in 12 hours and pitch their projects to a panel of judges at the end of the day. Hackathons are great ways to get students interested in programming and provide learning opportunities to all participants.</p>
		<br>

		<h3><b>Why are we doing this?</b></h3>
		<p>Hackathons are great ways to get people interested in computer science and robotics; however, most hackathons are targeted towards college students and are out of the realm of high schoolers. HackNA is specifically targeted to towards middle and high school students and is designed at exposing students to computer science and robotics fields at an earlier age. We also recognize that many people haven’t had the opportunities to learn about these fields, which is why we’re designing HackNA to help beginners get started with introductory workshops throughout the day.</p>
		<br>

		<h3><b>Why should you sponsor us?</b></h3>
		<p>Sponsoring us is a great way to give back to the community. Our goal is to introduce as many people to computer science and robotics as possible and to foster a high school community centered around technological innovation in the Greater Pittsburgh Area. Your contribution would help make this possible by helping students of all ages, skill levels, and backgrounds find that initial drive to learn more with no creative boundaries.</p>
		<p>Sponsoring us is also a great way to advertise your brand. We’ll be sure to put your logo on our website, t-shirts, and publicly thank you for your help. It’s also a great way to interact with some of the rising engineers and scientists across Pittsburgh.</p>
		<br>

		<h3><b>How can you help us?</b></h3>
		<p>We need all the help that we can get, so anything that you can do is greatly appreciated. Your contributions go directly towards supporting operating costs such as food, prizes, venue costs, t-shirts, and many, many other things that make hackathons fun and successful. There are many different ways to help out — for example, if you’re a local restaurant, you can help by catering a meal or providing snacks; if you’re a local businesses, you can help by sending us judges and mentors to help teams. We’ve outlined some suggested contributions below, but if you have anything else in mind, please feel free to contact us anytime at <a href="mailto:sponsor@hackna.org">sponsor@hackna.org</a>.</p>
